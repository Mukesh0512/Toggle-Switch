Project Summary: Toggle Switch in Python
Objective
To create a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python that features a toggle switch, allowing users to switch between two states (e.g., ON and OFF) and perform actions based on the switch state.

Tools and Libraries
Python: The programming language used for the project.
Tkinter: A standard GUI library in Python used for creating graphical interfaces.
Components
GUI Window: The main window that hosts the toggle switch.
Toggle Switch: A custom widget created using Canvas or standard Tkinter widgets.
State Handling: Logic to handle the ON/OFF state and perform actions based on the current state.
Labels and Buttons: Additional widgets to display information and allow user interaction.
Steps
Set Up the Environment: Install Python and ensure Tkinter is available.
Create the Main Window: Use Tkinter to create the main application window.
Design the Toggle Switch:
Use Canvas to draw the switch or combine standard widgets (e.g., buttons and labels).
Implement click events to change the switch state.
Handle the Toggle State:
Use a variable (e.g., Boolean) to track the switch state.
Update the switch appearance based on its state.
Perform specific actions (e.g., printing messages, enabling/disabling features) when the state changes.
Run the Application: Execute the script to display the GUI and interact with the toggle switch.
